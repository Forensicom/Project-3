# This file will hold all function to be used for analyzing a crypto currency

# functions to include:

# FUNCTION "cryptoPlot" - This is a plotting function that will plot daily close prices for a selected crypto in a line graph. This function will need to accept the input variable "selected". Note that The user will be able to make the selection using streamlit.selectbox. 

# 2. FUNCTION: "cryptoFrame" - A pandas dataframe that show daily open, close, high, low, volume and pct_change fo rthe crypto currency specified by the user.

# FUNCTION: "cryptoChg" - A function that calculates pct_change of the daily close price data



# FUNCTION "nowPrice" returns the current price for the crypto selected.
