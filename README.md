# Crypto Trading Platform
### Group4 Project 3: Crypto Currency Trading Platform
### Project Background
Before making the leap to becoming an investor, people need access to a platform that they can use to perform a basic analysis of a crypto currency.  The platform should have simple functions and be easy to use. Users should be able to obtain and analyze basic financial performance data on various crypto currencies. Ideally, the platform should include customizable graphs, past performance data, predictive analysis and perhaps even sentiment analysis.

Users will also want to be able to buy and sell the crypto currencies through that  platform. A portion of the platform should allow users to immediately buy or sell crypto currency of their choosing. That platform should also keep them informed as to their account balance and total investment portfolio. 
Project Goal
Create an easy to use crypto currency analysis and trading platform.
Project Objectives
Obtain daily and historical performance data for the top 5 crypto currencies
Use a logistic regression model to analyze the crypto currency data.
Create a small app that allows users to buy or sell one of the five crypto currencies.
Add a portfolio summary function to the buy/sell app
Publish a crypto trading platform app to the Streamlit Cloud
